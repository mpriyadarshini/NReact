1. What is `NPM`?

NPM is world's largest software registry. Open source developers use npm to share and borrow packages.

2. What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?

Parcel is a bundler used mostly for js or ts code that helps you to minify, clean and make your code compact so that it becomes easier to send request or receive response

3. What is `.parcel-cache`?

It stores information about your project when your parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds, it doesnt have to re-parse and re-analyze everything from scratch. Thats the reason why parcel is fast in development mode
